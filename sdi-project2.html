<p>I have decided to continue the theme of fighting a dragon in this second project. It follows the path of a young knight who must face off against a ferocious dragon. And the dragon is not happy about it.</p>
<p>While the story does seem rather simple, it has gotten more complex since the last battle with the dragon.</p>
